I am a Postdoctoral Scholar at Caltech, advised by Prof. Aaron Ames.
I received my PhD in Mechanical Engineering at UC San Diego under the supervision of Professor Jorge Cortés. I received a B.Sc in Mathematics and a B.Sc in Engineering Physics in 2020 from the Universitat Politècnica de Catalunya, in Barcelona. 
My research interests lie at the intersection of control theory, optimization, robotics, and networked systems.
